    <p class="discrip">Eating at night can have a direct effect on your mind and body. It is not just what you eat but the timing also is what matters to ensure your body functions properly.</p>
</div>
<div class="discrip">
    <p>The morning breakfast is termed the most important meal of the day by dietitians. It is your first meal of the day after a 6-8 hour gap. However, other meals, like lunch and dinner, are also important and should not be skipped. More importantly, skipping any of these meals will not help you lose weight, as is commonly believed.</p>
</div>
<div class="discrip"><p>Ayurveda tells us to be careful about what we eat at night. Its the last meal of the day, and it is important to consume it at the right time and consume less oily and easily digestible foods that are low in calories.</p></div>
<div class="discrip" ><p>This is because the end of the day is dominated by Kapha  and the food you consume must balance Kapha and not increase it. Continue reading to know what to eat at night.

<div class="discrip"><p >There are a few foods you must avoid eating at night since they create an imbalance in the kapha dosha. Junk food, oily food, nonvegetarian items, frozen food, heavy-to-digest food, curd, or ice cream are a few things that you must avoid eating during night time. Even if you eat them, try to have them in less or limited quantities. Eating more of them during the night may create an imbalance in the body and lead to complications like:</p></div>
<div  class="discrip">
    <ul class="fontweight">
        <li>Weight gain</li>
        <li>A runny nose when you wake up in the morning</li>
        <li>Cough and cold. If you are already suffering from a cough and cold, chances are the condition will worsen</li>
        <li>Vomiting sensation</li>
        <li>Indigestion</li>
        <li>Excessive salivation in the morning</li>
        <li>Allergies</li>
        
        
    </ul>

</div>

    <div><p class="discrip">Eventually, wrong eating habits can lead to the formation and accumulation of toxic substances in the body, which can cause several health complications.</p></div>
    <div class = "discrip"><p>If youre suffering from any of the above complications, it's high time you start taking proper care of yourself. Sometimes, a slight adjustment in your diet pattern can cure or improve most of these conditions. So, the next question that arises is what type of adjustments can improve your health.</p></div>

    <div class="discrip"><p>You must be wondering what can be healthy things to eat at night, right? Worry not, just follow these simple tips for dinner.</p></div>
<div class="discrip"><ul class="fontweight">
<li>It is suggested to eat food that is easy to digest at night. Also, try to eat a healthy and low-carb diet as it gets digested easily.</li>
<li>If you have the habit of eating curd at night, replace it with buttermilk. Prefer chapatis over rice since chapatis are easy and quicker to digest.</li>
<li>Do not overstuff yourself. Eat in limited quantities</li>
<li>Try to include more of dal, green leafy vegetables, curry leaves, and a small amount of ginger in your meal.</li>
<li>Salt is supposed to increase the water retention in the body. Hence, it is better to cut down on the intake of salt.</li>
<li>Spices, on the other hand, increase warmth in your body, so try to include spices in your food.</li>
<li>Reduce the sugar intake and replace it with honey as it helps in reducing the mucus.</li>
<li>If you have the habit of drinking milk before you sleep, prefer low-fat milk. Always boil the milk before drinking it. This makes it easier to digest. You can also add a small amount of ginger or cardamom to the milk before boiling it, which helps in reducing the mucus generating properties.</li>
<li>Do not drink cold milk. Have it while it is still warm.</li>
</ul></div>

<div class = "discrip"><p>The thumb rule you must follow while having your dinner is to make sure that whatever you eat, you should not get a feeling of heaviness in the stomach. Instead, your stomach must feel light so that you can sleep properly.</p></div>
<div class="discrip"><p>Does eating at night make you fat? There are chances. Since your body does not perform any physical activity at night, it requires less energy. And, if you eat in large quantities at night, the energy that is produced from the food gets stored in the body in the form of fat, and this finally leads to obesity or weight gain.</p></div>
